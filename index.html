      Promises to contribute were not kept.
      Update:
      Probably would never fulfill my promise to contribute to that project
      (not showing the name here but it&apos;s easy to check).
      Not being able to write or understand <strong>is</strong> not being able to write or understand.
      I promised in the first place because I was confident in my ability to learn things.
      I was too confident.
      More on this in a later blogpost.
      Will update.

      I&apos;m not trying to suggest doing harm nor do I believe all harm is equal.
      <br>
      It&apos;s just that I could not break this rule, no matter how hard I tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite this, I still want to pursue a resolution where no one is harmed.
      <br>
      Because some types of harm should and can be easily avoided
      if the people involved just take a bit of time to learn, to understand.

        <p>
          For example,
          the footer I have right now doesn't stick to the bottom of the viewport
          when the height of the content is not high enough.

          Static Site Generator?
        </h3>

        <p>
          For example, I should have used a static site generator instead of writing everything by hand.
        </p>

        <section id="to_solve_or_not_to_solve-to_list_some_problems_of_writing_everything_by_hand">
          <p>
            To list some problems of writing everything by hand:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                When writing any page other than the homepage, I need to write lots of duplicate code.
              </p>

              <p>
                Most prominently, the <code>header</code> and <code>footer</code>.
              </p>

              <p>
                This doesn't seem like a big problem at first,
                until I realize that when I change my implementation of the header and footer,
                I need to change them on every page.
              </p>

              <p>
                Same goes for every other piece of code.
              </p>

            My solution:

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Write <strong>everything</strong>, and I mean <strong>absolutely everything</strong> on the homepage.
              </p>

              <p>
                Contrary to many people's expectations, it wouldn't be too much a problem at first.
                <br>
                Why? Because modern browsers are capable of handling <strong>a lot</strong> raw, text content.
                And I mean <strong>a lot</strong>.
              </p>

              <p>

                Of course this is not scalable,
                but I guess
                I would probably have time to set that up
                once the amount of text I generate exceed the size of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>.

        <h3>
          GitHub Pages?
        </h3>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              I'm using GitHub pages to host this website despite owning a server.
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  That means it'll go down if GitHub deletes it.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                Also, GitHub pages cannot be accessed in certain countries.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              I'm (ab)using jsDelivr to host fonts instead of serving them from same-origin.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Surely those are problems. Problems which can be solved by self-hosting.
        </p>

        <p>
          But do I really need to solve those problems?
        </p>

        <p>
          I do want to solve the problem of website being inaccessible in certain countries due to using GitHub pages.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, to self-host means:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              If GitHub deletes it (unlikely, at least for now),
              I still have all the content, locally, due to using Git to deploy to GitHub Pages.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Website can be easily blocked due to me having limited ip addresses, and we are back to square one.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Having to keep up with dependencies, which, let&apos;s be honest, lots of us just don&apos;t.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Maintaining a server is time-consuming.
              It&apos;s not about I&apos;m actually typing the commands to update,
              it's about remembering to type the commands in the first place.
              <br>
              Therefore,
              security problems wouldn&apos;t get fixed in a timely manner <s>(or would just never get fixed)</s>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Therefore, I conclude that: now is not a good time to self-host this website.
